Parallel Execution**\n- All 3 agents completed work concurrently without blocking\n- Time savings: ~7 minutes vs ~20 minutes sequential (~65% faster)\n- No file-locking or coordination problems\n\n**2. Workspace Isolation**\n- Independent work in jj workspaces\n- No interference during development\n- Local testing without affecting main repo\n\n**3. Agent Communication**\n- Successful botbus coordination\n- Proper agent identities maintained\n- Visible progress in central channel\n\n**4. Code Quality**\n- wild-warden: 202 lines (subscription tracking + tests)\n- electric-junction: 218 lines (DM detection + multi-channel)\n- iron-bear: 171 lines (mention detection + hyphen fix)\n- All 113 tests passed after merge\n\n**5. Merge Process**\n- Proper 3-way merge created\n- Clear conflict markers\n- Manageable conflicts (2 files, 4 regions)\n\n### ⚠️ Challenges\n\n**1. Conflict Resolution**\n- Required manual intervention (src/cli/inbox.rs, src/main.rs)\n- Both agents modified same file extensively\n- Conflict markers needed cleanup\n\n**2. Agent Instructions**\n- Required very explicit workspace path instructions\n- Repeated emphasis on export BOTBUS_AGENT needed\n- Workspace navigation not intuitive\n\n**3. Review Process**\n- Difficult to view diffs before merge\n- Non-obvious syntax: jj diff -r <workspace>@\n- No built-in iteration mechanism\n\n**4. Bead Management**\n- Beads updated in workspaces\n- Manual sync needed after merge\n\n### 📊 Metrics\n- Features: 3 major\n- Lines: ~600 total\n- Tests: 113 passing (3 new)\n- Conflicts: 4 regions, 2 files\n- Time: 65% faster than sequential\n\n### 🎯 Recommendations\n\n**Use MAW for:**\n- Independent features touching different files\n- Experiments with multiple approaches\n- Fast parallel development\n\n**Skip MAW for:**\n- Sequential dependent features\n- Single-file refactors (conflict-prone)\n- Quick fixes\n\n### Final Verdict\nSuccess! MAW worked as intended. Conflicts were manageable. Would use again for independent features.","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-28T18:40:00.089415974Z","created_by":"bob","updated_at":"2026-01-28T18:57:30.511437865Z","closed_at":"2026-01-28T18:57:30.511404342Z","close_reason":"Informational experiment report — good data, no action needed","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["experiment","feedback","multi-agent"]}

This prevents pushing to GitHub and causes confusion.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Agent creates workspace: `maw ws create agent-1`\n- Agent makes commits with `jj commit` or `jj describe`\n- When coordinator tries to merge: `maw ws merge --all`\n- Commits exist in jj log but aren't on `main` bookmark\n- Git shows detached HEAD or main hasn't moved\n- `git push` has nothing to push\n\n**Root Cause:**\njj creates commits on a \"floating\" working copy, not directly on bookmarks/branches. After committing, you must explicitly move the `main` bookmark to include your commits:\n\n```bash\njj bookmark set main -r @-  # Move main to parent of working copy\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUpdate maw's agent documentation (AGENTS.md or generated guidance) to include jj bookmark workflow:\n\n### For Subagents (in workspaces)\n- Workspaces already isolate work, so subagents don't need to worry about bookmarks\n- Their commits get merged by coordinator\n\n### For Coordinator/Main Workspace\nAfter merging workspaces:\n\n```bash\n# After maw ws merge --all\njj bookmark set main -r @-    # Move main to include merged commit\njj git push                    # Push to GitHub\n```\n\n### Documentation Additions\n\n1. **Quick Start section** - Add jj first-time setup:\n   ```bash\n   jj bookmark track main --remote=origin  # One-time setup\n   ```\n\n2. **Workflow examples** - Show full commit-to-push flow:\n   ```bash\n   # Make changes\n   jj commit -m \"message\"\n   jj bookmark set main -r @-\n   jj git push\n   ```\n\n3. **Troubleshooting section** - How to recover if bookmark wasn't moved\n\n## Benefits\n- Agents won't lose work due to bookmark confusion\n- Clear path from workspace merge → GitHub push\n- Prevents accumulation of orphaned commits\n- Works consistently across projects using jj + maw\n\n## See Also\n- botbus AGENTS.md has similar guidance (lines 77-129)\n- jj tutorial: https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks/","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"enhancement","created_at":"2026-01-26T20:47:35.489967703Z","created_by":"bob","updated_at":"2026-01-26T20:50:48.324829152Z","closed_at":"2026-01-26T20:50:48.324804786Z","close_reason":"Done: Added 'Pushing to Remote' section to AGENTS.md with bookmark workflow, troubleshooting tips.
