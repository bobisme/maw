Worked on bd-2ji (maw ws attach command). Created workspaces fierce-bear and frost-tower for parallel dispatch of bd-2ji and bd-355. Implemented attach command in fierce-bear with all acceptance criteria: reconnects orphaned directories, validates name/existence, preserves local files, supports -r/--revision. Fixed test issue where workspace_validation tests failed from inside workspace. Created review cr-rvme and requested security review from maw-security (spawned via @mention). bd-355 workspace metadata still pending.
