Completed bd-3bs (Add --dry-run flag to maw ws merge):
1. Created workspace swift-viper, claimed bead and workspace
2. Implemented --dry-run flag with preview_merge() function that shows:
   - Changes per workspace via jj diff --stat
   - Potential conflicts (files modified in multiple workspaces)
   - Summary with command to run actual merge
3. Tested manually with single workspace and multiple workspaces including conflict detection
4. All tests pass
5. Requested and received security review cr-3c2d - LGTM
6. Encountered crit database corruption during merge (events.jsonl truncation) - recovered by restoring workspace.rs from jj history
7. Pushed to main as commit 4ac88935
8. Closed bd-3bs with full details
8 ready beads remain: bd-j2z, bd-dmg, bd-3a8, bd-23b, bd-2v6, bd-10y, bd-2ji, bd-355
