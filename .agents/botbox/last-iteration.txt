Implemented bd-2v6 (pre/post-merge hooks support) and bd-10y (automatic stale workspace detection) in parallel workspaces. Created workspaces frozen-lynx (for hooks) and electric-forest (for stale detection), implemented both features, merged them, and created review cr-30a3 for security review. Reviewer maw-security spawned via @mention. Awaiting review before merge/push. 2 P4 beads remain (bd-2ji workspace attach, bd-355 workspace metadata).
