Processed inbox: created bead bd-1bi from botty-dev feedback about stale workspace handling. Found 2 ready beads (bd-3m9, bd-1bi), groomed both with acceptance criteria. Worked both beads sequentially:
- bd-3m9: Added trailing slash to workspace path outputs in ws create/attach/list/prune
- bd-1bi: Added stale workspace detection and warning to [36mmaw ws jj[0m command

Merged workspaces (red-panther, electric-otter), created combined review cr-3dru, requested security review from @maw-security. Reviewer spawned. Awaiting review approval before merge.

Resume check found claims on bd-3m9, bd-1bi with review cr-3dru pending. Security reviewer (maw-security) is online and actively reviewing (status expires in ~29min). No new inbox messages requiring action. Review events show only creation and reviewer request - no votes or comments yet. No other ready beads to work on. Continuing to wait for review approval before merge.
