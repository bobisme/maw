Completed one dev cycle:
1. Checked inbox - message from bob to work on bead bd-3mr
2. Found 1 ready bead: bd-3mr "Add implicit rebase to maw ws merge"
3. Created workspace ember-reef and staked claims
4. Implemented the feature:
   - Added [36msync_stale_workspaces_for_merge()[0m function that checks each workspace being merged for staleness and syncs them using [36mjj workspace update-stale[0m
   - Integrated it into the merge function after pre-merge hooks but before the actual rebase
   - Updated help text to document the automatic sync behavior
5. Built and tested successfully (all 8 tests pass)
6. Created review cr-fu8d and requested maw-security reviewer
7. Reviewer has been spawned via @mention

Waiting for security review of cr-fu8d before merge.

Resumed work on bead bd-3mr "Add implicit rebase to maw ws merge". The implementation was complete from the previous iteration but the review (cr-fu8d) wasn't found. Fixed a divergent commit in workspace ember-reef by abandoning qxsrrzuy/0. Created new review cr-2tof, requested maw-security reviewer, and spawned the reviewer via @mention. Reviewer maw-security is now online and starting review loop. Waiting for security review before merge.
