No CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM issues found. Two LOW defense-in-depth observations: (1) Branch name in InitOptions.branch not validated before passing to git checkout -B — mitigated by Command API (no shell injection) and git's own ref name validation. (2) bf_clean_root_tracked_files trusts git ls-tree output for file paths without verifying path containment within root — mitigated by git's own tree object validation. Code correctly uses Command::new (no shell execution), validates OIDs via EpochId/GitOid types, canonicalizes paths, and has proper error handling. Good test coverage with 14+ unit tests."}}
